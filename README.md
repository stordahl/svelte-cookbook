# Svelte Cookbook

A community built resource, for productive Svelte Development

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server:

```bash
bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.
